-P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS as Perl-compatible regular expressions
              (PCREs).  This option is experimental when combined with
              the -z (--null-data) option, and grep -P may warn of
              unimplemented features.
-R, --dereference-recursive
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow
              all symbolic links, unlike -r.
-i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so
              that characters that differ only in case match each other.
-n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
              within its input file.
